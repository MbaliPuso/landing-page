   <p>In recent years, there has been a rising trend towards downsizing and simplifying our lives. One manifestation of this movement is the increasing popularity of tiny homes. These compact dwellings, typically measuring <em>less than 500 square feet,</em>
    offer an array of benefits beyond their small size. Not only are they environmentally friendly and promote a minimalistic lifestyle, but they also present an opportunity for cost-effective living.
